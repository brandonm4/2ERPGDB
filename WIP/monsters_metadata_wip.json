    "description": "The aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the peaks of the\nhighest mountains, spending their days soaring on the thermal winds in peace and\nsolitude.   Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet.\nAbout halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized\nfingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extends the length of\nthe wing and locks in place for flying. Though the wing-hands cannot grasp\nduring flight, they are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is on\nthe ground and its wings are folded back. The wing muscles anchor in a bony\nchest plate that provides the aarakocra with extra protection. The powerful legs\nend in four sharp talons that can unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of\nfunctional hands, also with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb.\nThe hand bones, like the rest of an aarakocra's skeleton, are hollow and\nfragile.   Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. They\nhave gray-black beaks, and black eyes set frontally in their heads that provide\nkeen binocular vision. Plumage color varies from tribe to tribe, but generally\nmales are red, orange, and yellow while females are brown and gray.   Aarakocra\nspeak their own language, the language of giant eagles, and, on occasion, the\ncommon tongue (10% chance).  Combat"

It has a long, squat body, ranging in size\nfrom a scant foot to well over ten feet long. Most mature specimens range from\neight to 15 feet long, and some even larger. Many sages argue that crocodiles\nnever stop growing. The crocodile has a long jaw filled with sharp, conical\nteeth. The powerful maw is superbly adapted for dragging prey beneath the water\nand dismembering it. Its four short legs are very powerful, and can propel the\ncrocodile rapidly through the water and over the land. Its long tail is also\nvery strong and is sometimes used on land to unbalance its foes.   The crocodile\nis covered with a tough horny hide, which blends in very well with the\nsurrounding water. Its eyes and nose are placed so that when the crocodile\nfloats, only they remain above water, enabling the beast to spot and ambush\nprey.

They are as elusive as they are\nalluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise -- or\nthey wish to be spotted.   The dryad's exquisite features, delicate and finely\nchiseled, are much like an elf maiden's. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber,\nviolet, or dark green eyes. A dryad's complexion and hair color changes with the\nseasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a\ndryad's hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual\nlight tan to more closely match her hair color. This enables her to blend with\nthe falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad's hair and skin are\nwhite, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When encountered in a forest\nduring fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid,\nprobably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during\nthe spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad's skin is\nlightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.   Dryads\noften appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the\ncolor of the oak grove in the season they appear.

    "description": "Though their lives span several human generations, elves appear at first glance\nto be frail when compared to man. However, elves have a number of special\ntalents that more than make up for their slightly weaker constitutions.   High\nelves, the most common type of elf, are somewhat shorter than men, never growing\nmuch over than 5 feet tall. Male elves usually weigh between 90 and 120 pounds,\nand females weigh between 70 and 100 pounds. Most high elves are dark-haired,\nand their eyes are a beautiful, deep shade of green. They posses infravision up\nto 60 feet. The features of an elf are delicate and finely chiseled.   Elves\nhave very pale complexions, which is odd because they spend a great deal of time\noutdoors. They tend to be slim, almost fragile. Their pale complexion and slight\nbuilds are the result of a constitution that is weaker than man's. Elves,\ntherefore, always subtract 1 point from their initial Constitution score. Though\nthey are not as sturdy as humans, elves are much more agile, and always add 1\npoint to their initial Dexterity scores. Elven clothing tends to be colorful,\nbut not garish. They often wear pastel colors, especially blues and greens.\nBecause they dwell in forests, however, high elves often wear greenish grey\ncloaks to afford them quick camouflage.   Elves have learned that it is very\nimportant to understand the creatures, both good and evil, that share their\nforest home. Because of this, elves may speak the tongues of goblins, orcs,\nhobgoblins, gnolls, gnomes, and halflings, in addition to common and their own\nhighly-developed language. They will always show an interest in anything that\nwill allow them to communicate with, and learn from, their neighbors.  Combat"

Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are\norange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark\ngreen. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly\ncured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only\nreasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and\ngnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90\nyears.  Combat"

    "description": "8,000  Eastern  9,000  Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the\nworld, none is more dreadful than the vampire. Moving silently through the\nnight, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compassion. Unless deep\nunderground, they must return to the coffins in which they pass the daylight\nhours, and even in the former case they must occasionally return to such to\nrest, for their power is renewed by contact with soil from their graves.   One\naspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many of its undead kindred\nis its appearance. Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass\namong normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial\nfeatures are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a\nvampire's true nature is revealed only when it attacks.   There are ways in\nwhich a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast\nno reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.  Combat"

They can alter their own color, shape, and\nsize to some extent and can be easily mistaken for lanterns,  light  spells, and\nsimilar sources of artificial illumination.   If they do not attack, will\no'wisps are able to utterly blank out their glows, rendering them invisible to\nall those who cannot spot invisible objects, for 2-8 melee rounds.   The will\no'wisp language is a most unusual one, being purely optical in nature. All\ncommunication between will o'wisps is by means of changes in color or\nbrightness, many of which are far too subtle for the average observer to notice.\nBecause this form of exchange is almost impossible to mimic, it is very\ndifficult for travelers to communicate with these creatures. Exceptional\nexamples of this race have mastered a very simple sound-based language. They\nproduce sounds by vibrating very rapidly and thus have a shallow and ghostly-\nsounding voice when they \"speak.\"  Combat"
