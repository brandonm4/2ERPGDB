    "description": "This powerful spell calls into being a number of floating, silver spheres, up to as many spheres as the caster has levels. Each of these spheres has the ability to absorb a single spell, spell-like ability, or magical effect of any offensive type. After absorbing the spell the sphere fades out, taking the spell energy with it.\n\nOffensive spells can generally be considered to be those which inflict damage on the target or place the target under a baneful or harmful influence. Passive spells (such as walls) can sometimes be used in situations with harmful intent. Intent and situation are as important as spell effect for determining whether a spell is offensive or not for purposes of the epuration working. Various walls, spheres, some of Bigby\u2019s spells, and most abjurations will not affect the epuration spell. Those spells which have area effects in which a silver sphere exists (such as a fireball) will simply not function\u2014the magical energy will be sucked into the sphere before the damage is inflicted.\n\nSpells which are already in effect when the silver spheres enter them are not affected by this spell, but they are automatically negated if cast within 10 feet of a silver sphere. Items with charges of offensive spells (such as wands) can be negated if the sphere is placed on or in front of the wand. Otherwise, the spheres do not affect magical items or weapons, or potentially lethal items that are not activated, such as symbols.\n\nThe caster can direct the spheres to drift at a maximum movement rate of 60 feet per round, up to the limit of the spell range. The spheres created from a single epuration must move as a group; the caster cannot move them individually or split them up. The wizard creating them may cast other spells, but cannot move the spheres in the same round.\n\nThe caster can move and fight and move the spheres at the same time. If the caster leaves the area without the spheres, they remain until they absorb an offensive spell. Similarly, if the caster is slain, the silver spheres remain in the area, not moving, but not inflicting any damage.\n\nThe silvery spheres of epuration cannot be physically moved or attacked. They have no solid, physical presence and can pass through magical and physical barriers alike without harm.\n\nNeither the caster nor anyone else can harness the spell energy dissipated by the spheres. Even the spell-like abilities of powers and creatures from other planes can be affected by the silvery spheres of an epuration, though the beings themselves may not be.",

    "description": "In casting this spell, the wizard calls into being the spell engine, a great wheel that absorbs magical energy, in particular cast spells. When initially cast, the engine is unactivated and remains invisible in the location where the wizard cast it. Once a spell is cast in the area of effect around the engine, the spell engine activates. A great intangible wheel 12 feet in diameter and 2 feet thick shimmers into existence. Magical energies used in the area will cause the great wheel to turn, shining with a glowing white light from the energy present. Once activated, the spell engine will not deactivate; rather, it will eventually slow down from lack of spell energy and become ghostly and translucent.\n\nWhen activated, the spell engine absorbs all spell energy cast in the area of effect, reaching through solid objects to do so. Wizard and priest spells, spell-like abilities of monsters and individuals, and magical items with castable charges will not function in this area. Their energy is sucked into the wheel, which glows brighter and spins faster with every addition. Unlike the spelltrap, the spell engine cannot be overloaded.\n\nA spell engine can be destroyed by direct contact with a magical item (excluding potions and scrolls but including artifacts and unique magical items). The engine will explode on contact with such an item, inflicting 1\u201320 points of damage to everyone within 10 feet and 1\u20138 to everyone between 10 and 20 feet away from the wheel itself. The magical item is destroyed as well in the explosion. Artifacts and unique items (such as special purpose swords) are not destroyed, but they (and their wielder) are bodily moved to another plane or dimension. Getting home from there is the character\u2019s problem.\n\nA dispel magic spell will not destroy the spell engine, as its energy will be sucked up in the process. Symbols, glyphs, and abjuration magics already in place at the time the spell engine is activated are not absorbed, though new spells of that variety cast in the area are. A disintegrate spell will cause the engine to explode the same as if it contacted a magical item.\n\nAn operating spell engine has one beneficial sidelight\u2014if a spellcaster studies or prays in its light, the amount of time required to learn or receive spells is halved. This does not reduce the time required for rest, only to memorize spells.\n\nOther than the powers listed above, the spell engine does not affect living beings. Individuals with magical items will not affect an unactivated spell engine. Only the casting of a spell in the area of effect will call the spell engine into being.",

The body does not die, rather it is placed in a state of suspended animation. It cannot be harmed by magic or by physical force, or even be moved. The body does not age, breathe, or eat and is not subject to disease, rot, infection, or poison, even if these states existed in it before it was disminded.\n\nThe mind itself is cast loose invisibly across the Prime Material plane, where it drifts serenely, undetectable by any means. Like the body, the mind cannot be harmed by any known process. It cannot control its movement or what it sees, and its memory is erratic. The DM should feel free to provide one to six small scenes, phrases, or situations for the disminded mind to witness in its flight, as seeds for future adventures. While in its disminded state, the mind cannot think, pray, study or research spells, or even choose to observe any particular person or locale.\n\nMind and body can be linked together by a limited or full wish or by the reverse of this spell, restore mind. The restore mind is cast on the body and the mind is immediately brought back. Mind and body must be on the same plane in order for this spell to function.\n\nRestore mind has a number of other functions as well: it can cure insanity (both magical and otherwise), remove feeblemindedness, and break all mental or magical controls, including geas, quests, and charms. A saving throw applies to the restore mind and if failed, body and mind are still separate.\n\nThe dismind spell in its original form is often used by high level wizards in life-or-death situations to preserve themselves for future recovery and restoration.",

    "description": "This powerful spell calls into being a number of floating, silver spheres, up to as many spheres as the caster has levels. Each of these spheres has the ability to absorb a single spell, spell-like ability, or magical effect of any offensive type. After absorbing the spell the sphere fades out, taking the spell energy with it.\n\nOffensive spells can generally be considered to be those which inflict damage on the target or place the target under a baneful or harmful influence. Passive spells (such as walls) can sometimes be used in situations with harmful intent. Intent and situation are as important as spell effect for determining whether a spell is offensive or not for purposes of the epuration working. Various walls, spheres, some of Bigby\u2019s spells, and most abjurations will not affect the epuration spell. Those spells which have area effects in which a silver sphere exists (such as a fireball) will simply not function\u2014the magical energy will be sucked into the sphere before the damage is inflicted.\n\nSpells which are already in effect when the silver spheres enter them are not affected by this spell, but they are automatically negated if cast within 10 feet of a silver sphere. Items with charges of offensive spells (such as wands) can be negated if the sphere is placed on or in front of the wand. Otherwise, the spheres do not affect magical items or weapons, or potentially lethal items that are not activated, such as symbols.\n\nThe caster can direct the spheres to drift at a maximum movement rate of 60 feet per round, up to the limit of the spell range. The spheres created from a single epuration must move as a group; the caster cannot move them individually or split them up. The wizard creating them may cast other spells, but cannot move the spheres in the same round.\n\nThe caster can move and fight and move the spheres at the same time. If the caster leaves the area without the spheres, they remain until they absorb an offensive spell. Similarly, if the caster is slain, the silver spheres remain in the area, not moving, but not inflicting any damage.\n\nThe silvery spheres of epuration cannot be physically moved or attacked. They have no solid, physical presence and can pass through magical and physical barriers alike without harm.\n\nNeither the caster nor anyone else can harness the spell energy dissipated by the spheres. Even the spell-like abilities of powers and creatures from other planes can be affected by the silvery spheres of an epuration, though the beings themselves may not be.",
