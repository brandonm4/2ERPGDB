      "description": "This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance\u2014in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral.\n\nThe spell gives no indication of the \u201cdirection\u201d in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions. However, it does indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.\n\nFor example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.\n\nA priest has a **5% chance per level** of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance).\n\nSimilar to spells such as *detect evil*, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap.\n\nIf cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \u201canimal\u201d or \u201cnon-,\u201d it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).\n\nThe material components are **four iron coins**, which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting.",

      "description": "**This spell** allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into higher dimensions.\n\nThis effect can be best explained through an example.\n\nIf an ant crawling along the west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl the full width of the map.\n\nBut if the map were folded in two so that the east and west edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all.\n\nThe ant's world (the map) would have been folded through the third dimension.\n\nThe dimensional folding spell does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same plane of existence.\n\nAlthough this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell teleport, in practice, it is much different.\n\nThe dimensional folding spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous, bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane.\n\nThis gate is circular, of any size up to 10' in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round.\n\nThe caster and any other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open.\n\nMissile weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate.\n\nThe gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to starshine.\n\nVision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing the priest to \"look before he leaps.\" However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able to see the priest and his point of origin.\n\nThe \"near side\" of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest.\n\nThe location of the \"far side\" of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires.\n\nThus, there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell teleport.\n\nThere is a risk involved in using dimensional folding, however.\n\nMany philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this spell seems to support this thesis.\n\nUnless the priest is extremely familiar with the destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a dimensional folding gate will suffer instantaneous aging.\n\nTheorists believe that this is the same kind of \"slippage\" that can cause a teleporting wizard to land high or low, except that in this case, the slippage is in the time dimension.\n\nThe chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest is with the destination.\n\nThe table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging.\n\nChance of Amount of Destination is: aging aging Very familiar* 2% 1 year Studied carefully 5% 1d2 years Seen casually 10% 1d3 years Viewed once 15% 1d6 years Never seen 25% 1d10 years * Use this row if the desired location is within view of the priest.\n\nIf the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate in either direction suffers the aging effect.\n\nMultiple creatures passing through the gate in the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll.\n\nAlthough the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time.\n\nAlthough the word \"destination\" is used to refer to the \"far end\" of the gate, the priest need not be the one doing the traveling.\n\nFor example, a priest may open the gate near a distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest.\n\nThe material component is a sheet of platinum \"tissue\" worth at least 15 gp, which the priest folds intricately during the casting.\n\nThe tissue is consumed when the gate closes.",

it is invisible and intangible.\n\nItem foci are centered on a single object.\n\nCustomarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.\n\nThe item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.\n\nLiving foci are the rarest of all types.\n\nIn this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person.\n\nDetect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.\n\nThe type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified.\n\nThese choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.\n\nCasting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals.\n\nDuring the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith.\n\nThese aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it).\n\nTheir duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting.\n\nA large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy.\n\nNot surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.\n\nThe duration of the focus is one year.\n\nIf the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner.\n\nA focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers.\n\nLay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten.\n\nA focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above).\n\nThe focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day.\n\nIf these conditions are not met, the focus weakens.\n\nThe area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.\n\nOnce the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus.\n\nA focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus.\n\nSpells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.\n\nTable 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10' radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.\n\nThe focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power.\n\nAfter one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect.\n\nThereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails.\n\nThe area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster.\n\nThe spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller.\n\nWithin that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect.\n\nA 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter.\n\nThe material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate.\n\nThe cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified.\n\nThese items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast.",

Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment).\n\nA character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class.\n\nCertain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class.\n\nFor example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief.\n\nBoth will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed.\n\nSuch characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.\n\nDementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking.\n\nNothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction.\n\nNo matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.\n\nDelusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage.\n\nCharacters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief.\n\nThe subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold.\n\nHe directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.\n\nParanoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him.\n\nEveryone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot.\n\nIf any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.\n\nHallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist.\n\nThe more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate.\n\nAlthough most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception.\n\nFor example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.\n\nWhen this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms).\n\nIf the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.\n\nWhile under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however.\n\nPlayer characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.\n\nThe duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores.\n\nA saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total.\n\nThe spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled.\n\nRefer to the table that follows.\n\nInt+Wis Time Between Checks 8 or less 1 month 9 to 18 3 weeks 19 to 24 2 weeks 25 to 30 1 week 31 to 35 3 days 36 or more 1 day The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose.\n\nThe material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china.\n\nThe priest shatters this bust during the casting.",

      "description": "When a priest enters othertime, he steps into a different reality in which the world around him is frozen at a moment in the future.\n\nUntil time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world.\n\nFor instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him.\n\nTo his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point.\n\nThe duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least.\n\nThe priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher.\n\nThe duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast othertime.\n\nThe caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means.\n\nWhile the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening events.\n\nIn the example above, if the caster's friends were teleported away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his \"friends,\" frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime.\n\nThis also means that nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him-he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him.\n\nAs noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell.\n\nBy leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the othertime.\n\nHe could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him.\n\nIf the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a -4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike.\n\nLeaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out.\n\nOnly the most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament.\n\nOnce a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells.\n\nAfter all, if the priest is going to attract his deity's attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out! The material component for this spell is an hourglass filled with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces.",

However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires--the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity.\n\nAlthough the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time.\n\nIf the priests are not released at the end of the spell's duration, they instantly die.\n\nA deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane.\n\nSuch a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy.\n\nFor dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain.\n\nIf a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM.\n\n(Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.) While the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance.\n\nThe priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them).\n\nAny damage to a priest's body requires an instant system shock roll.\n\nIf successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die).\n\nIf the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends.\n\nCharacters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated.\n\nThey have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered.\n\nIf the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends.\n\nEven if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained.\n\nAll spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again.\n\nThe physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast.\n\nSince damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him).\n\nEach priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god).\n\nThe material component is an offering appropriate to the deity.\n\nThe DM determines the exact nature of this offering.",

      "description": "**This spell** enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion.\n\nFamiliars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice.\n\nA creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well.\n\nA wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come.\n\nThe creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life.\n\nThe wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls.\n\nNormal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).\n\nThe wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to one mile.\n\nNote that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic - while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses.\n\nThus a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse.\n\nCertainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the \"big ones\" it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.\n\nIf separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.\n\nWhen the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizards saving throws against special attacks.\n\nIf a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed.\n\nIf the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die.\n\nEven if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.\n\nThe power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year.\n\nWhen the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal.\n\nWhen this is burning well, he adds 1.000 gp worth of incense and herbs.\n\nThe spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished.\n\nThe DM secretly determines all results.\n\nNote that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away.\n\nDeliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master.\n\nPurposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.\n\nOn a d20 roll of 1-5 a black Cat is summoned, granting excellent night vision & superior hearing On a d20 roll of 6-7 a Crow is summoned, granting excellent vision On a d20 roll of 8-9 a Hawk is summoned, granting very superior distance vision On a d20 roll of 10-11 a Owl is summoned, granting night vision equal to human daylight vision and superior hearing On a d20 roll of 12-13 a Toad is summoned, granting wide-angle vision On a d20 roll of 14-15 a Weasel is summoned, granting superior hearing & very superior olfactory power On a d20 roll of 16-20 no familiar is available within spell range The referee can substitute other small animals suitable to the area.",

As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.\n\nWhen the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively).\n\nThe creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available.\n\nCreatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\n\nWhen the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20).\n\nFor each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20.\n\nAdditionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively).\n\nThe chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.\n\nA subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic.\n\nOnce this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.\n\nExample: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities.\n\nIf it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.\n\nThe wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll.\n\nThose who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form.\n\nThus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc.\n\nHis companions will most likely consider him mad.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon.",

      "description": "Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the 3rd-level alteration spell blink, allowing the wizard to shift his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location.\n\nUnlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing.\n\nFor example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack.\n\nIf the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses - but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach.\n\nIf the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks.\n\nIf he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won\u2019t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.\n\nA blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow.\n\nThe fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss.\n\nAt that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9.\n\nIn the Player\u2019s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions.\n\nIf the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter\u2019s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.\n\nBecause the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles.\n\nIf he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the Player's Handbook for determining where he ends up).",

It can **detect invisible** and **ethereal creatures**, making it an excellent guardian. It does not react to illusions that are not at least quasi-real.\n\nIf the intruding creature **exposes its back** to the watchdog, the dog delivers a **vicious attack** as if it were a **10-Hit Dice monster**, striking for **3d6 damage**. It can hit even creatures only affected by +3 or greater magical weapons. Creatures without backs (e.g., ochre jellies) are not attacked.\n\nThe faithful hound **cannot be attacked**, but it can be **dispelled**. The spell lasts **1 hour + \u00bd hour per caster level**, but once activated by an intruder, it lasts only **1 round per caster level**.\n\nIf the caster is ever more than **30 yards** from the guarded area, the spell ends.\n\n**Material components**: A **tiny silver whistle**, a **piece of bone**, and a **thread**.\u3010644:3\u2020TSR 2159 - Player's Handbook.pdf\u3011",

      "description": "This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item.\n\nThe enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic.\n\nThe item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100gp.\n\nWith respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved.\n\nIf such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.\n\nThe wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened.\n\nAny magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.\n\nThe item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster.\n\nThis touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days).\n\nAll work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again.\n\n(Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.) At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test.\n\nHe will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs.\n\nspell, the spell is completed.\n\nThe spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3.\n\nA result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications.\n\nOnce the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item.\n\nThe spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.\n\nEach spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast.\n\nAgain, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person.\n\nThis procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours o the last, even if the prior spell failed.\n\nNo magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch.\n\nThis always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell.\n\nAlso, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made.\n\nNaturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent.\n\nMagical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.\n\nThe materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it.\n\nFor example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of kirin.\n\nThese specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.",

The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier.\n\nThe caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.\n\nThe DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive).\n\nThis rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature.\n\nIf the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service.\n\nNew offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement.\n\nThis can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell.\n\nImpossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.\n\nOnce the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came.\n\nThe creature might later seek revenge.",

The items will fly 10 feet in random directions, rebound against the limits of the spell and bounce around inside the area of effect for one round, damaging those caught in the area.\n\nNo less than six items or more than 14 can be affected. The items can be no larger than chicken eggs and are typically such things as coins, marbles, gems, dice, or sling bullets. Items which are in pouches or otherwise restrained are not affected, though those in an open pouch could be enchanted by this spell.\n\nCreatures of size S generally take 1\u20136 points of damage from the shrapnel while those of size M take 1\u20134 and those of size L and larger are unharmed. A successful save vs. spells negates the damage. Small creatures flying into a scatterspray must save vs. spells or be grounded, unable to fly, for 1\u20134 turns. Size M or larger flying creatures are unharmed. Magical protection such as *shield*, *wall of force*, *Bigby\u2019s hands*, and *protection from normal missiles* will protect those within from the effects of the scatterspray. The caster is always unharmed by the scatterspray, even if within its area of effect.\n\nThe damage from scatterspray assumes hard objects are used for missiles. Eggs, fruit, and other soft objects can be used, but this reduces damage by 2 points in all cases (down to a minimum of 0). Spellcasting is not possible from inside a scatterspray if the spell-casting opponent fails a saving throw vs. spells.",

      "description": "This powerful spell calls into being a number of floating, silver spheres, up to as many spheres as the caster has levels. Each of these spheres has the ability to absorb a single spell, spell-like ability, or magical effect of any offensive type. After absorbing the spell the sphere fades out, taking the spell energy with it.\n\nOffensive spells can generally be considered to be those which inflict damage on the target or place the target under a baneful or harmful influence. Passive spells (such as walls) can sometimes be used in situations with harmful intent. Intent and situation are as important as spell effect for determining whether a spell is offensive or not for purposes of the epuration working. Various walls, spheres, some of Bigby\u2019s spells, and most abjurations will not affect the epuration spell. Those spells which have area effects in which a silver sphere exists (such as a fireball) will simply not function\u2014the magical energy will be sucked into the sphere before the damage is inflicted.\n\nSpells which are already in effect when the silver spheres enter them are not affected by this spell, but they are automatically negated if cast within 10 feet of a silver sphere. Items with charges of offensive spells (such as wands) can be negated if the sphere is placed on or in front of the wand. Otherwise, the spheres do not affect magical items or weapons, or potentially lethal items that are not activated, such as symbols.\n\nThe caster can direct the spheres to drift at a maximum movement rate of 60 feet per round, up to the limit of the spell range. The spheres created from a single epuration must move as a group; the caster cannot move them individually or split them up. The wizard creating them may cast other spells, but cannot move the spheres in the same round.\n\nThe caster can move and fight and move the spheres at the same time. If the caster leaves the area without the spheres, they remain until they absorb an offensive spell. Similarly, if the caster is slain, the silver spheres remain in the area, not moving, but not inflicting any damage.\n\nThe silvery spheres of epuration cannot be physically moved or attacked. They have no solid, physical presence and can pass through magical and physical barriers alike without harm.\n\nNeither the caster nor anyone else can harness the spell energy dissipated by the spheres. Even the spell-like abilities of powers and creatures from other planes can be affected by the silvery spheres of an epuration, though the beings themselves may not be.",

      "description": "In casting this spell, the wizard calls into being the spell engine, a great wheel that absorbs magical energy, in particular cast spells. When initially cast, the engine is unactivated and remains invisible in the location where the wizard cast it. Once a spell is cast in the area of effect around the engine, the spell engine activates. A great intangible wheel 12 feet in diameter and 2 feet thick shimmers into existence. Magical energies used in the area will cause the great wheel to turn, shining with a glowing white light from the energy present. Once activated, the spell engine will not deactivate; rather, it will eventually slow down from lack of spell energy and become ghostly and translucent.\n\nWhen activated, the spell engine absorbs all spell energy cast in the area of effect, reaching through solid objects to do so. Wizard and priest spells, spell-like abilities of monsters and individuals, and magical items with castable charges will not function in this area. Their energy is sucked into the wheel, which glows brighter and spins faster with every addition. Unlike the spelltrap, the spell engine cannot be overloaded.\n\nA spell engine can be destroyed by direct contact with a magical item (excluding potions and scrolls but including artifacts and unique magical items). The engine will explode on contact with such an item, inflicting 1\u201320 points of damage to everyone within 10 feet and 1\u20138 to everyone between 10 and 20 feet away from the wheel itself. The magical item is destroyed as well in the explosion. Artifacts and unique items (such as special purpose swords) are not destroyed, but they (and their wielder) are bodily moved to another plane or dimension. Getting home from there is the character\u2019s problem.\n\nA dispel magic spell will not destroy the spell engine, as its energy will be sucked up in the process. Symbols, glyphs, and abjuration magics already in place at the time the spell engine is activated are not absorbed, though new spells of that variety cast in the area are. A disintegrate spell will cause the engine to explode the same as if it contacted a magical item.\n\nAn operating spell engine has one beneficial sidelight\u2014if a spellcaster studies or prays in its light, the amount of time required to learn or receive spells is halved. This does not reduce the time required for rest, only to memorize spells.\n\nOther than the powers listed above, the spell engine does not affect living beings. Individuals with magical items will not affect an unactivated spell engine. Only the casting of a spell in the area of effect will call the spell engine into being.",

The body does not age, breathe, or eat and is not subject to disease, rot, infection, or poison, even if these states existed in it before it was disminded.\n\nThe mind itself is cast loose invisibly across the Prime Material plane, where it drifts serenely, undetectable by any means. Like the body, the mind cannot be harmed by any known process. It cannot control its movement or what it sees, and its memory is erratic. The DM should feel free to provide one to six small scenes, phrases, or situations for the disminded mind to witness in its flight, as seeds for future adventures. While in its disminded state, the mind cannot think, pray, study or research spells, or even choose to observe any particular person or locale.\n\nMind and body can be linked together by a limited or full wish or by the reverse of this spell, restore mind. The restore mind is cast on the body and the mind is immediately brought back. Mind and body must be on the same plane in order for this spell to function.\n\nRestore mind has a number of other functions as well: it can cure insanity (both magical and otherwise), remove feeblemindedness, and break all mental or magical controls, including geas, quests, and charms. A saving throw applies to the restore mind and if failed, body and mind are still separate.\n\nThe dismind spell in its original form is often used by high level wizards in life-or-death situations to preserve themselves for future recovery and restoration.",

      "description": "This powerful spell calls into being a number of floating, silver spheres, up to as many spheres as the caster has levels. Each of these spheres has the ability to absorb a single spell, spell-like ability, or magical effect of any offensive type. After absorbing the spell the sphere fades out, taking the spell energy with it.\n\nOffensive spells can generally be considered to be those which inflict damage on the target or place the target under a baneful or harmful influence. Passive spells (such as walls) can sometimes be used in situations with harmful intent. Intent and situation are as important as spell effect for determining whether a spell is offensive or not for purposes of the epuration working. Various walls, spheres, some of Bigby\u2019s spells, and most abjurations will not affect the epuration spell. Those spells which have area effects in which a silver sphere exists (such as a fireball) will simply not function\u2014the magical energy will be sucked into the sphere before the damage is inflicted.\n\nSpells which are already in effect when the silver spheres enter them are not affected by this spell, but they are automatically negated if cast within 10 feet of a silver sphere. Items with charges of offensive spells (such as wands) can be negated if the sphere is placed on or in front of the wand. Otherwise, the spheres do not affect magical items or weapons, or potentially lethal items that are not activated, such as symbols.\n\nThe caster can direct the spheres to drift at a maximum movement rate of 60 feet per round, up to the limit of the spell range. The spheres created from a single epuration must move as a group; the caster cannot move them individually or split them up. The wizard creating them may cast other spells, but cannot move the spheres in the same round.\n\nThe caster can move and fight and move the spheres at the same time. If the caster leaves the area without the spheres, they remain until they absorb an offensive spell. Similarly, if the caster is slain, the silver spheres remain in the area, not moving, but not inflicting any damage.\n\nThe silvery spheres of epuration cannot be physically moved or attacked. They have no solid, physical presence and can pass through magical and physical barriers alike without harm.\n\nNeither the caster nor anyone else can harness the spell energy dissipated by the spheres. Even the spell-like abilities of powers and creatures from other planes can be affected by the silvery spheres of an epuration, though the beings themselves may not be.",
