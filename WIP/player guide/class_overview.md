# ðŸ§™ Character Classes Overview

### **Cleric**
The most common type of priest is the cleric. The cleric may be an adherent of any religion (though if the DM designs a specific mythos, the cleric's abilities and spells may be changedâ€”see following). Clerics are generally good, but are not restricted to good; they can have any alignment acceptable to their order. A cleric must have a Wisdom score of 9 or more. High constitution and Charisma are also particularly useful.

### **Druid**
Druids are priests of nature and neutrality. They are the guardians of the wilderness and protectors of the balance of the land. Druids are responsible for preserving the natural order, maintaining the balance between the elements, and ensuring that neither good nor evil, law nor chaos, gains the upper hand. Druids are aloof from the more mundane aspects of mankind and prefer the company of animals and plants over civilization.
