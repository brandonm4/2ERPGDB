      "description": "This spell actually consists of a variety of different rituals, the \nnature of which will vary from religion to religion, but whose \ngeneral pattern is universal. The cost of casting the spell for \neach will vary, but all involve the use of the caster\u2019s holy symbol. \nThe effect of a ceremony spell is not magical, and thus cannot \nbe dispelled with a dispel magic spell. There are sixteen specific \napplications of the ceremony spell, and the caster must specify \nwhich is being learned when choosing which spells he is \nmemorizing: \nAnathema: This ceremony can only be cast by a cleric of 9th \nlevel or higher, and is never done for money. It creates a brand \nor other highly visible mark (on the hand, forehead, cheek, etc.) \nthat declares the target to be utterly cast out of his former faith. \nIf the ceremony is cast upon an unwilling recipient, he is entitled \nto a saving throw with a -4 penalty. The mark of anathema can \nbe removed by a successfully cast atonement spell (see p. 171 \nfor details). If the reason for someone being cast out was caused \nby some sort of magical control (like a forced alignment change), \nthe mark of anathema can be fully removed. If not, some vestige \nof the mark will always remain.  \nBurial: This ceremony can be performed by a 1st level cleric or \nmystic, and costs 5-50 g.p. When cast upon a dead body, it \nfunctions as a protection from evil spell (see p. 273). In addition, \nanyone attempting to disinter the body must make a saving \nthrow vs. spells or flee in panic for 1 turn.  \nCast out. This ceremony may be performed by a druid of 12th \nlevel or higher (but all except the grand druid require permission \nfrom a superior in the druidical hierarchy of at least arch druid \nrank). It is a special form of excommunication that is inflicted on \nthose who have committed egregious harm to Nature. Unwilling \n\nADVENTURES DARK AND DEEP\u2122 Core Rulebook \ntargets are entitled to a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty. \nThose who are cast out will bear an unclean aura that will be \nsensed by any non-magical animal (such as bears, pigs, birds, \nhorses, etc.) and all druids and followers of the druidical faith. A \nvates may reverse a casting out ceremony at will. Druids who \nrequest permission to perform the ceremony and are refused, or \nwho have the ceremony reversed, may themselves fall under \nthe discipline of the hierarchy.  \nComing of age: This ceremony can be performed by a 1st level \ncleric, druid, or mystic, and costs 5-15 s.p. It is usually cast on \nsomeone entering into adulthood, and affords him a bonus of +1 \nto any single saving throw.  \nConsecrate ground: This ceremony can be cast by a 7th level \ncleric, and usually will cost 100-600 g.p., depending on the size \nof the area to be consecrated. It is used to prepare a given area \nfor the construction of some religious temple, shrine, or other \nedifice. It must be cast before any work whatsoever is done on \nthe site, or else it is useless. If the ceremony is omitted or \nimproperly cast, the resulting structure will immediately begin to \nfall into disrepair and has a 1% chance per year of collapsing. If \ncast upon land intended as a burial ground, the area will \nautomatically turn undead as a 3rd level cleric (if cast by a good- \nor neutral-aligned caster), or undead in the area will be treated \nas if a 3rd level cleric were controlling them for purposes of being \nturned (if cast by an evil-aligned caster).  \nConsecrate item: This ceremony may be performed by a 3rd \nlevel cleric, and does not usually bear any cost. It is through this \nceremony that items for use on altars, in shrines, etc., are \nprepared.  \nDedication: This ceremony can be performed by a 3rd level \ncleric or druid, and costs 1-10 s.p. The spell brings the (always \nwilling) target into the ranks of the sanctioned worshippers of the \ncaster\u2019s faith (this will almost always require that the recipient\u2019s \nalignment be the same as that of the caster). It can be \noverridden only by another dedication ceremony performed by \na caster of higher level than the previous one.  \nInitiation: This ceremony grants the 7th-level druid the power to \nchange shape and have charm immunity to the powers of \nwoodland creatures (see Nature Immunity on p. 57 for details). \nIt is usually cast by another druid of 7th level or higher, but in \nextremis can be cast by the druid on himself.  \nInvestiture: This ceremony can be performed by a 3rd level cleric \nor druid, and costs 1-100 g.p. This is the ceremony by which a \n1st-level cleric or druid is officially made a celebrant of his \nreligion.  \nMarriage: This ceremony may be performed by a 1st level cleric, \ndruid, or mystic, and costs 1-20 g.p. It does not otherwise afford \nany magical effects.  \nOrdination: This ceremony may be performed by a 3rd level \ncleric, and costs up to 200 g.p. (but some faiths will perform the \nceremony at no cost). This ceremony is necessary before any \ncleric is able to establish a temple, have a regular congregation, \nand gain followers. \nRest eternal: This ceremony may be performed by a 1st level \ndruid. It is cast upon the mortal remains of some creature, and \nfoils spells such as raise dead and resurrection. A wish spell, \nhowever, would be able to overcome the effects of the \nceremony. \nSacred grove. This ceremony may be performed by a druid of \n9th level. It is cast upon his regular sacred grove, thus protecting \nthe trees of the grove from disease, wind damage, flooding, etc. \nThe effect will last for as long as the druid maintains the grove.  \nSpecial vows: This ceremony can be performed by a 5th level \ncleric, 6th level mystic, or 7th level druid, and is always cast \nupon a cavalier, blackguard, or paladin, costing from 1 up to 100 \ng.p. This spell will grant the recipient immunity to the spell \nbestow curse for its duration, but will also impose a -4 penalty to \nany saving throws vs. spells for the spell quest when cast by a \nspellcaster of the same alignment as the caster of the ceremony \nspell. The special vows will remain in place until the recipient \ngains enough experience points to attain the next experience \nlevel. Druids cannot perform the ceremony on paladins, \nalthough they can on cavaliers regardless of alignment.  \nVow of silence: This ceremony can only be performed by a \nmystic upon reaching the 9th level of experience. The effects \nare listed under the description of the mystic character class, on \np. 44.  \nWorship. This ceremony comprises the ordinary worship of the \ncaster\u2019s religion, and can be performed by a 1st level cleric or \ndruid. It can be performed either singularly or for a group. The \nexact nature of the worship ceremony will vary from faith to faith. \nFaithful attending such a ceremony earn 1 x.p. for doing so, a \nmaximum of once per day."

The orb will affect even creatures normally struck only by \nenchanted weapons, but magic resistance will still apply. The \neffect of the orb will depend on its color: \n**Pearl:** The pearl orb will inflict 1-4 h.p. of damage if it hits, and \nwill generate a bright light (as per the spell) for 1 round per level \nof the caster. The target must make a saving throw or be blinded \nwhile the light persists. Any level caster can create a pearl orb. \n**Ruby:** The ruby orb will inflict 1-6 h.p. of damage if it hits, and \nwill generate heat sufficient to melt 1 cubic yard of ice or snow. \nCreatures struck must save vs. spell or lose 1 point each of \nstrength and dexterity (or a -1 penalty to both \u201cto hit\u201d and armor \nclass ratings). Only a caster 2nd level or above can create a \nruby orb. \n**Flame:** The flame orb will inflict 1-8 h.p. of damage if it hits, and \nwill set flammable objects alight. Creatures struck must save vs. \nspells or take an additional 2 h.p. of damage (does not apply to \ncreatures resistant to fire damage). The caster must be 3rd level \nor higher to create the flame orb. \n**Amber:** The amber orb will cause 1-10 h.p. of damage if it hits. \nCreatures struck must save vs. spells or be struck blind for 2-5 \nrounds. The amber orb can only be created by a 4th level caster \nor higher. \n**Emerald:** The emerald orb will cause 1-12 h.p. of damage if it \nhits. The orb releases a stinking cloud in a 5\u2019 radius; creatures \nin the area must save vs. spells or be helpless for 2-5 rounds \n(those who successfully save can move out of the area of the \nstinking cloud; see p. 299 for details). The emerald orb can only \nbe cast by a 5th level caster or above.  \n**Turquoise:** The turquoise orb will cause 2-16 h.p. of damage if it \nhits. In addition, it will magnetize any iron, steel, or other metal \nthat can hold a magnetic field for 3-12 rounds, unless the target \nmakes a successful saving throw vs. spells. Such metal will \nattract all other iron-based metal (including swords, etc.), which \nmust be then pulled off. The turquoise orb can only be cast by a \n6th level or higher caster.  \n**Sapphire:** The sapphire orb will cause 2-8 h.p. of damage if it \nhits. In addition, the target must make a saving throw vs. \npetrification or be paralyzed for 5-20 rounds. It can only be cast \nby someone 7th level or higher. \n**Amethyst:** The amethyst orb will cause the target to be slowed \n(as per the spell; see p. 289 for details) for 2-8 rounds if it hits. \nIn addition, the target must make a saving throw vs. petrification \nor be turned to stone, permanently. The amethyst orb can only \nbe cast by someone 10th level or higher. \n**Ashen:** The ashen orb will cause the target to be paralyzed for \n2-5 rounds if it hits. In addition, the target must make a saving \nthrow vs. death or be instantly slain. The ashen orb can only be \ncast by someone 12th level or higher. \nThe spell requires a small gem (50 g.p. value) of the type \nindicated, or else a clear one (such as diamond) which will serve \nfor all of the orbs indicated.

If the caster is of a lower level, then the chance \ndecreases by 2% per difference in levels.  \nIf the level of the creator of a given item is unknown, assume the \nminimum plus 1d4 (see Creating Magic Items on p. 320 for \ndetails).
