The cost of casting the spell for each will vary, but all involve the use of the caster\u2019s holy symbol. The effect of a ceremony spell is not magical, and thus cannot be dispelled with a dispel magic spell. There are sixteen specific applications of the ceremony spell, and the caster must specify which is being learned when ch...\n\n- **Anathema**: This ceremony can only be cast by a cleric of 9th level or higher, and is never done for money. It creates a brand or other highly visible mark (on the hand, forehead, cheek, etc.) that declares the target to be utterly cast out of his former faith. If the ceremony is cast upon an unwilling recipient, he is entitled to a saving throw with a -4 penalty. The mark of anathema can be removed by a successfully cast *atonement* spell. If the cause was magical control, the mark can be fully remo...\n\n- **Burial**: Cast by a 1st level cleric or mystic (cost: 5\u201350 g.p.). Functions as *protection from evil* on the dead body. Anyone who attempts to disinter the body must save vs. spells or flee in panic for 1 turn.\n\n- **Cast Out**: A druid of 12th level or higher (with hierarchical permission) may excommunicate someone for violating Nature. The target receives a save vs. spells at -4. An aura of uncleanness is sensed by druids and natural animals. Reversals may trigger punishment from the druid hierarchy.\n\n- **Coming of Age**: Cleric, druid, or mystic (1st level; cost: 5\u201315 s.p.). Cast on someone entering adulthood. Grants +1 to any single saving throw.\n\n- **Consecrate Ground**: 7th level cleric (cost: 100\u2013600 g.p.). Must be cast before any construction. If omitted, structure decays and may collapse. If cast for a burial ground, it grants turn undead powers or bolsters undead depending on alignment.\n\n- **Consecrate Item**: 3rd level cleric. Used for altars, shrines, etc. No typical cost.\n\n- **Dedication**: 3rd level cleric or druid (cost: 1\u201310 s.p.). Inducts a willing target into the caster\u2019s religion. Reversible only by higher-level caster.\n\n- **Initiation**: Cast by or upon a 7th level druid to gain shapechange and charm immunity.\n\n- **Investiture**: 3rd level cleric or druid (cost: 1\u2013100 g.p.). Formally recognizes a 1st-level cleric/druid as an official celebrant.\n\n- **Marriage**: 1st level cleric, druid, or mystic (cost: 1\u201320 g.p.). No magical effect.\n\n- **Ordination**: 3rd level cleric (cost: up to 200 g.p.). Required to form temples and gain followers.\n\n- **Rest Eternal**: 1st level druid. Protects mortal remains from *raise dead* or *resurrection*. *Wish* bypasses.\n\n- **Sacred Grove**: 9th level druid. Protects grove from environmental harm. Permanent while maintained.\n\n- **Special Vows**: 5th level cleric, 6th level mystic, or 7th level druid (cost: 1\u2013100 g.p.). Cast on cavaliers, blackguards, or paladins. Grants immunity to *bestow curse* but imposes a -4 to saves against *quest* from same-aligned casters.\n\n- **Vow of Silence**: Mystic-only, 9th level. Grants specific class powers.\n\n- **Worship**: 1st level cleric or druid. Daily ritual granting 1 x.p. to worshipers. The ritual varies by faith.",

The orb will affect even creatures normally struck only by \nenchanted weapons, but magic resistance will still apply. The \neffect of the orb will depend on its color: \n**Pearl:** The pearl orb will inflict 1-4 h.p. of damage if it hits, and \nwill generate a bright light (as per the spell) for 1 round per level \nof the caster. The target must make a saving throw or be blinded \nwhile the light persists. Any level caster can create a pearl orb. \n**Ruby:** The ruby orb will inflict 1-6 h.p. of damage if it hits, and \nwill generate heat sufficient to melt 1 cubic yard of ice or snow. \nCreatures struck must save vs. spell or lose 1 point each of \nstrength and dexterity (or a -1 penalty to both \u201cto hit\u201d and armor \nclass ratings). Only a caster 2nd level or above can create a \nruby orb. \n**Flame:** The flame orb will inflict 1-8 h.p. of damage if it hits, and \nwill set flammable objects alight. Creatures struck must save vs. \nspells or take an additional 2 h.p. of damage (does not apply to \ncreatures resistant to fire damage). The caster must be 3rd level \nor higher to create the flame orb. \n**Amber:** The amber orb will cause 1-10 h.p. of damage if it hits. \nCreatures struck must save vs. spells or be struck blind for 2-5 \nrounds. The amber orb can only be created by a 4th level caster \nor higher. \n**Emerald:** The emerald orb will cause 1-12 h.p. of damage if it \nhits. The orb releases a stinking cloud in a 5\u2019 radius; creatures \nin the area must save vs. spells or be helpless for 2-5 rounds \n(those who successfully save can move out of the area of the \nstinking cloud; see p. 299 for details). The emerald orb can only \nbe cast by a 5th level caster or above.  \n**Turquoise:** The turquoise orb will cause 2-16 h.p. of damage if it \nhits. In addition, it will magnetize any iron, steel, or other metal \nthat can hold a magnetic field for 3-12 rounds, unless the target \nmakes a successful saving throw vs. spells. Such metal will \nattract all other iron-based metal (including swords, etc.), which \nmust be then pulled off. The turquoise orb can only be cast by a \n6th level or higher caster.  \n**Sapphire:** The sapphire orb will cause 2-8 h.p. of damage if it \nhits. In addition, the target must make a saving throw vs. \npetrification or be paralyzed for 5-20 rounds. It can only be cast \nby someone 7th level or higher. \n**Amethyst:** The amethyst orb will cause the target to be slowed \n(as per the spell; see p. 289 for details) for 2-8 rounds if it hits. \nIn addition, the target must make a saving throw vs. petrification \nor be turned to stone, permanently. The amethyst orb can only \nbe cast by someone 10th level or higher. \n**Ashen:** The ashen orb will cause the target to be paralyzed for \n2-5 rounds if it hits. In addition, the target must make a saving \nthrow vs. death or be instantly slain. The ashen orb can only be \ncast by someone 12th level or higher. \nThe spell requires a small gem (50 g.p. value) of the type \nindicated, or else a clear one (such as diamond) which will serve \nfor all of the orbs indicated.

If that is the case, that creature will be affected first (if it is susceptible to the spell, of course). Otherwise, creatures within the area of effect will be affected in order, from lowest number of hit dice to highest. When determining whether the spell still has enough strength to put a given creature to sleep, round down.\n\nCreatures affected by the *sleep* spell may be slain at a rate of one per round (more, if there is more than one person doing the slaying). Noise will not awaken creatures affected by the spell, but shaking, slapping, or wounding will. Waking up takes a full round and creatures will naturally wake up on their own after 5 rounds per level of the caster.\n\nThe spell requires either fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket, all of which are destroyed during the casting of the spell.",
