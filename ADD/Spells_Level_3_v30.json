The target(s) must be within 30\u2019 of the caster, and must all be within a 20\u2019 x 20\u2019 area; up to 4 targets may be so affected. The targets do get a saving throw vs. spells; if there is only 1 target, he gets a -2 penalty on his save; if there are 2 targets, they get -1 penalties; 3 or 4 targets make their saving throws normally.\n\nNote that this spell won\u2019t negate the effects of other mind-altering spells cast on the target during the time erased from memory, but it might make the target forget who cast those spells in the first place! The spell can be negated by means of a *heal*, *restoration*, or *wish* spell."

This takes precedence over lower chakras being awakened, and will be lost if higher chakras are awakened.)\n\nIf the first and second chakras have been awakened prior to the third, the recipient gains 1 point of constitution for as long as all three spells remain in effect, subject to racial maximums.

A full inch of rain will fall in but a single round, after which time the spell will have run its course. Even the largest non-magical fires will be extinguished by the time the spell is done, while permanent magical fires will reignite themselves after a round or two. Small flame-based spells such as *burning hands* will be rendered ineffectual, while larger area-based fire spells such as *flame strike* or *fireball* will cause an immense cloud of steam some 120\u2019 in diameter and 240\u2019 high that does 1\u20133 hit points of damage to most creatures, and twice that to cold-based or cold-using creatures. The steam will last 2\u20135 rounds under normal conditions, but only a single round in strong wind.\n\nIn dry conditions, the spell will only operate as a double-strength *precipitation* spell. In humid climates, the spell will have twice its normal duration. At the freezing mark, the rain will become ice and sleet, while below freezing up to 10\u201d of snow will fall. There is no electrical component to the spell, and thus it cannot be used to accommodate a *call lightning* spell.\n\nThe spell requires a pinch of powdered silver and powdered iodine crystals, which are consumed as the spell is cast, and the caster\u2019s holy symbol, which is not. When cast by a magic-user, no holy symbol is required.\n\nThis spell cannot be cast underwater."

They must be cast within the next six hours or they are lost. Note that these spells are \u201cbonus\u201d spells and do not need to be previously memorized to be stored within the crystal.\n\nThe spell requires a crystal of at least 100 g.p. value, which is not destroyed by the casting. Note that the same crystal cannot be used to power different versions of this spell at the same time, and multiple castings of the spell cannot be active simultaneously (even if a different specific effect is chosen).

      "description": "This spell allows the caster to make a proposal in such a way that the listener will be disposed to agree to it. The listener, of course, must be able to understand what is being said. The listener gets a saving throw vs. spells to resist the suggestion, but if it is a particularly reasonable-sounding proposition, the save is made at a penalty of -1 or even -2 (at the game master\u2019s discretion).\n\nThe suggestion can never be obviously harmful, deadly, or against the interests of the hearer, but (for instance) a suggestion that a giant agree to a truce to help an adventuring party attack a nearby orc lair, with the giant getting a share of the loot, is certainly within the bounds of the spell. A maximum of two short sentences can be used to make the suggestion. It requires a snake\u2019s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or sweet oil, which are lost as the spell is cast.",
