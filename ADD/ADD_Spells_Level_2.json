      "description": "This spell calls forth an enchanted arrow made of pure green acid, which flies forth at the designated target as if it were an arrow +1 fired from a longbow by a fighter of the same level as the caster.\n\nWhen it hits, the arrow itself does 2\u20135 h.p. of damage. The target is also splashed with the acid of the arrow (and thus creatures that would not normally be damaged by such an arrow may still be harmed by the acid, and vice versa).\n\nThe acid itself causes 2\u20138 h.p. of damage per round in a 1\u2019 diameter area, and those items vulnerable to acid damage must make saving throws.\n\nThe number of rounds the acid persists depends on the level of the caster: 1 round for every three levels. Thus a 4th level caster would evoke an arrow whose acid would remain for 2 rounds, doing 2\u20138 h.p. per round; a 7th level caster\u2019s arrow would last 3 rounds, etc.\n\nThe spell requires a normal dart, powdered rhubarb, and the stomach of an adder. All are lost in the casting. If cast underwater, the arrow will last only a single round before being dissipated by the water.",
