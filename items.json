For example, if a wizard casts 15 spell levels that count against the robe\u2019s daily limit and he then removes the robe, subsequent spells do not count against the robe\u2019s limit. If the wizard then puts on the robe during the same day and casts more spells, the robe retains the 15 spell levels that counted against it and all spells cast subsequently also count against the robe.\n\nOnly one wizard may use the robe\u2019s magic in a single day; if a second wizard puts on the robe, it does not function.",

It can be used to extract the greatest possible benefit from certain single-use magical items by partly diluting or admixing them. All potions, oils, dusts, incenses, glues, solvents, and Nolzur's marvelous pigments can be affected by Tenser's portmanteau.\n\nFor every two potions, applications of dust, or similar substances that are treated by the portmanteau, a third active dose or use can be extracted. Any such item may be affected only once by the power of the portmanteau. Single doses (a single potion, etc.) do not provide sufficient magic for treatment by the portmanteau.\n\nThe process of extracting the magic is not a simple task. The work takes 2d6 hours to complete. At the end of this time, the wizard must make an Intelligence check. If successful, the third dose is created. If failed, the third dose fails and only enough remains of the original materials for a single dose of the magical substance.\n\nIf *Alamir's fundamental breakdown* is cast during the process, the wizard gains a +2 to his Intelligence check. In this situation, the spell does not consume the magical items on which it is cast.\n\nEach use of the portmanteau consumes some of the special agents required for the process. When discovered, the case holds enough materials to attempt 4d10 duplications.",

The bottle can be used to store and protect important memories and thoughts, and is often used by powerful characters as a way of managing their (potentially cluttered) memories.\n\nTo use the bottle, a character concentrates on the thought or memory to be stored. He then uncorks the bottle and speaks the word of command. The thought or memory is then transferred from the character's brain into the bottle. All details of the thought or memory are held within the bottle. The caster remembers the general nature of the thought but need not worry about forgetting specific details, since these are trapped in the thought bottle.\n\nTo retrieve a thought, a character uncorks the bottle and speaks another word of command. The thought or memory is then transferred directly into the user's brain.\n\nThought bottles are sometimes used to protect vital information. A messenger carrying vital plans through enemy territory where there is a significant chance of capture and subsequent interrogation might carry all sensitive plans in one or more bottles. The messenger does not know the contents or the command word and therefore cannot reveal the contents of the bottles. Likewise, a spy could gain secret information, transfer it to a thought bottle, then use *forget* or *modify memory* to wipe this information from his mind. After this, regardless of the methods used, the spy is incapable of revealing the sensitive information.\n\nThought bottles are sometimes used as \"memory archives,\" where characters can save memories that are cluttering up their minds. This would be more of a problem for long-lived races such as elves, since the sheer volume of memories recorded over several centuries could be overwhelming.\n\nThought bottles will function (in both storage and retrieval) for any intelligent creature.\n\nWhen discovered, 75% of all thought bottles can hold only a single thought or memory. The remaining 25% have a capacity of 2d4 separate thoughts or memories. There is a separate word of command for each \"thought slot.\"",

All metal items tempered in this manner suffer no ill effects from heat on any of the inner planes, but suffer the effects of heat normally on the Prime Material plane.\n\nThe effect of the magical protection lasts 12 to 30 days (2d10+10). Magical armor or weapons that are placed in the forge take on the protection from heat, but temporarily lose their other magical properties.
